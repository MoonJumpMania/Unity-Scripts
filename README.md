## CamCtrl2D.cs
Aligns the camera to the x, y or both positions of any GameObject.
```
Attach to the camera and specify the GameObject that it will follow.
You can set the speed of the camera with bounce. (Less is slower and more bouncy)
You can select isAxisX and isAxisY to choose the axis that the camera will be following.
The offset is to allign the camera in whichever way you want.
```
NOTE: This has not been tested in 3D games.
